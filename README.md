# message-board

## Description:
Mini message board built with Express and vanilla JS. This was my first mini project using Node and Express and goal was to practice server-side programming concepts such as routing, using middleware, error handling, and using a template engine. 

## Live demo: 
https://fierce-woodland-06350.herokuapp.com/

NOTE: Starting 11/28/2022 the live version will no longer be available due to Heroku removing free hosting


## Lessons Learned: 
* Using Express/Node to set up and deploy a simple web application (hosted on Heroku)
* Use .get() send requests from the client to the server and .post() to send responses from the server to the client 
* Practice creating route handlers in Express applications
* Practice using templates for displaying different views in conjuction with the requested route
* Deeper understanding of how to use middleware effectively
* Practice using the EJS template engine
* Error handling and debugging in Express
* Practice setting up and deploying an app on Heroku


## Project Features: 

* Home page shows a log of messages including the body, author, and date added
* Navigate to the 'create message' page and fill in the fields to submit a message
